# Honeypot

## Objective

The objective of my honeypot project was to create a controlled and monitored environment designed to mimic real systems, attracting potential attackers to study their techniques, behavior, and methods. By deploying a deliberately vulnerable system, the project aimed to gather actionable intelligence on attack patterns, malware, and exploitation techniques while minimizing risks to production environments. The insights obtained from this setup were used to strengthen defenses, improve threat detection capabilities, and enhance the overall security posture by understanding real-world cyber threats in a practical context.tanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Learned to manage Linux systems, including configuring networks and firewalls.  
- Deployed and managed honeypots to simulate real-world environments.  
- Monitored and analyzed network traffic to detect suspicious activities.  
- Used REMnux tools to analyze malware samples and understand their behavior.  
- Gathered threat intelligence by identifying attack patterns and extracting IOCs.  
- Managed cloud infrastructure on Vultr, including deploying and scaling virtual machines.  
- Collected and analyzed logs for forensic investigations.   
- Assessed risks and applied mitigation techniques to secure systems.  
- Documented findings and prepared reports to share insights and improve security practices.  

### Tools Used

- REMnux: For malware analysis, reverse engineering, and threat research.  
- Vultr: For deploying and managing cloud-based virtual machines.  
- Wireshark: For capturing and analyzing network traffic.  
- Snort/Suricata: For intrusion detection and traffic analysis.  
- iptables: For configuring firewall rules.  
- tcpdump: For capturing raw network traffic for further analysis.  
- Python: For automating tasks and scripting custom analysis tools.
